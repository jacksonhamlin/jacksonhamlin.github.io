    "text": "Drive for show, putt for dough. If you find yourself on any golf course in the world, there is a good chance you hear this saying at least once. Don’t be surprised if you hear it from the group of 80 year olds taking 30 minutes to play one hole.\nWhat about driving distance though? As time goes by, golfers are hitting the ball further and further. In fact, the average driving distance in the 1990’s was 262 yards. In the 2010’s, it was 287 yards. In recent years we have also seen these power hitters finding a lot of success on tour, and it really has become obvious that these players have found an edge over their opponents.\nSo, which skill produces more “dough”? Let’s look at some numbers to determine which is more important to lowering golf scores.\nKaggle: PGA Tour Data site provides us with multiple sets of data from the 2010-2018 PGA Tour seasons. This data set includes valuable numbers such as, average driving distance, average putts per round, top 10 finishes, and average score throughout the season.\nFirst off, let’s look at the top three players from the 2010-2018 era. These top three are based off of their average score and top 10 finishes during the eight year span. In golf, the best golfers shoot the lowest score, and more top 10 finishes relates to consistency, which is key in the game of golf. Here are the top three.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ngolfdata <- read.csv(\"pgaTourData.csv\")\n\nnewgolf <- golfdata %>%\n  filter(Rounds > 0, Points > 100, Top.10 > 0) %>%\ngroup_by(Player.Name) %>%\n  summarise(\n    AvgDistance = mean(Avg.Distance),\n    AvgPutts = mean(Average.Putts),\n    AvgScore = mean(Average.Score),\n    Top10s = sum(Top.10)\n  )\n\nbestofthebest <- golfdata %>%\n  filter(Rounds > 30, Points > 100, Top.10 > 4) %>%\n  group_by(Player.Name) %>%\nsummarise(AvgScore = mean(Average.Score),\n          Top10ss = sum(Top.10),\n          AvgDistance = mean(Avg.Distance),\n          AvgPutts = mean(Average.Putts)) %>%\n  top_n(20, wt =-AvgScore) %>%\n  arrange(AvgScore)\n\nbombers <- golfdata %>%\n  filter(Rounds > 30, Points > 100, Top.10 > 5) %>%\n  group_by(Player.Name) %>%\nsummarise(AvgScore = mean(Average.Score),\n          Top10ss = sum(Top.10),\n          AvgDistance =mean(Avg.Distance),\n          AvgPutts = mean(Average.Putts))  %>%\n  arrange(desc(AvgDistance))\n\nbestputters <- golfdata %>%\n  filter(Rounds > 50, Points > 200, Top.10 > 0) %>%\n  group_by(Player.Name) %>%\nsummarise(AvgScore = mean(Average.Score),\n          Top10ss = sum(Top.10),\n          AvgPutts = mean(Average.Putts),\n          AvgDistance = mean(Avg.Distance)) %>%\n   top_n(20, wt =-AvgPutts ) %>%\n  arrange(AvgPutts)\n\ngoats <- bestofthebest  %>%\n top_n(3, wt=-AvgScore) %>%\n  mutate(Type = \"The Best Overall\") %>%\n  filter(Player.Name != \"Dustin Johnson\")\n\nbombersforlife <- bombers %>%\n  top_n(3, wt=AvgDistance) %>%\n  mutate(Type = \"Long Hitters\")\n\nputtersforlife <- bestputters %>%\n  top_n(3, wt =-AvgPutts ) %>%\nmutate(Type = \"Best Putters\")\n\ncombined <- bind_rows(puttersforlife, bombersforlife, goats)\n\nbestofthebest %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  cols_label(\n    Top10ss = \"Top 10's\",\n    Player.Name = \"Golfer\",\n    AvgScore = \"Average Score\",\n    AvgDistance = \"Average Distance\",\n    AvgPutts = \"Average Putts\") %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Low scores on the PGA Tour result in...

Again, some familiar names at the top, and we also have seen Dustin Johnson in the top 3 of another chart; Best players based off of top 10 finishes and average scores.\nNow let’s dive into something a little deeper. Does a low amount of putts correlate to lower scores? This scatter plot shows the correlation of average putts per round and average score. There is a correlation, but it isn’t showing us much.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=newgolf, aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgPutts), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=newgolf, aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgPutts), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgPutts, color=Type)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=combined, \n    aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgPutts, label=Player.Name),size=3) + \n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#DAA520\", \"#000080\", \"#8B0000\")) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Average Score\",\n    y = \"Average Putts per Round\",\n    title = \"Is putting the key to lower golf scores?\",\n    subtitle = \"The best putters on tour.. average low 70's.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: PGA Tour Data | By Jackson Hamlin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor =element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing the small correlation between a low number of putts and lower scores, let’s look at how driving distance affects average score.\nThis scatter plot clearly shows a larger correlation between average driving distance and average score. The longer you drive the ball, the more likely you are to shoot lower scores. Putt for dough? Hmm.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=newgolf, aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgDistance), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=newgolf, aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgDistance), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgDistance, color=Type)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=combined, \n    aes(x=AvgScore, y=AvgDistance, label=Player.Name),size=3) + \n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#DAA520\", \"#000080\", \"#8B0000\")) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Average Score\",\n    y = \"Average Distance\",\n    title = \"Does power off the tee result in lower golf scores?\",\n    subtitle = \"The further the ball goes..the lower the score goes.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: PGA Tour Data | By Jackson Hamlin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor =element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, it would be smart to see how both driving distance and putting correlates to top 10 finishes. Once again, top 10 finishes results in more dough. This bubble chart with the size of the dot scaled by number of top 10’s shows that golfers who drive the ball further on average off the tee, have more top 10 finishes than those who average a lower amount of putts.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=newgolf, \n    aes(x=AvgDistance, y=AvgPutts, size=Top10s), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=AvgDistance, y=AvgPutts, size=Top10ss, color=Type), alpha=.3)+\n   geom_text(aes(x=305, y=28, label=\"Good Driver, Good Putter\"), size=2.9, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=280, y=28.9, label=\"Bad Driver, Good Putter\"), size=2.9, color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_text(aes(x=280, y=30.5, label=\"Bad Driver, Bad Putter\"), size=2.9, color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_text(aes(x=305, y=30.5, label=\"Good Driver, Bad Putter\"), size=2.9, color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 290.8136) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 29.14646) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=combined, \n    aes(x=AvgDistance, y=AvgPutts, label=Player.Name),size=3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#DAA520\", \"#000080\", \"#8B0000\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Average Distance\",\n    y = \"Average Putts per Round\",\n    title = \"Where do the best putters and drivers stand in Top 10 finishes?\",\n    subtitle = \"Good golfers are good at everything, but the long drivers take the lead here.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle: PGA Tour Data | By Jackson Hamlin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor =element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nData is hard to beat. Especially in the game of golf, numbers don’t lie. Golf is a rapidly changing game, but as for now, Drive for show, putt for dough? That just may not be the case."
